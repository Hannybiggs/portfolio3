         <p class="subheading">Hello! I'm Hannah Biggam, a people-centred innovator propelled by answering the “why” behind it all. Currently based in Amsterdam, I have muti-disciplinary experience and formal training spanning three continents; North America, Asia, and Europe. I've been involved in a variety of sectors and roles, from event management and sales in creative spaces, to growth consultation in tech, to entrepreneurial music-industry ventures. Currently I'm expanding my skills into more technical avenues and gaining full-stack accreditation. Restless when not learning something new. Forever interested in what makes people tick, making things connect, and making ideas come to life. </p>

      <p>All of my work is guided to the big picture with a keen interest in details and creativity in developing systems from a humanistic point of view. Each item was crafted by discovering pain points and answering the “why” behind it all. Long-term impact is key and present at the forefront of each individual venture.
